## Gather

The [tidyr](){:.rlib} package's `gather` function reshapes "wide" data frames into "long" ones.

```{r title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
library(tidyr)
tidy_response <- gather(response, key = "treatment",
  value = "response", -trial)
```

===

All columns, accept for "trial", are stacked in two columns: a "key" and a "value". the key column gets the name `treatment` and the value column reveives the name `response`. For each row in the result, the key is taken from the name of the column and the value from the data in the column.

===

```{r}
tidy_response
```

Some notes on the syntax: a big advantage of [tidyr](){:.rlib} and [dplyr](){:.rlib} is that each function takes a data frame as its first argument and returns a new data frame. As we will see later, it makes it very easy to apply these functions in a chain. All functions also use column names as variables without subsetting them from a data frame (i.e. `trial` instead of `response$trial`).

===

Some analyses require a "wide" data format rather than the long format produced by `gather`. The community ecology package [vegan](){:.rlib} uses a matrix of species counts, where rows correspond to species and columns to sites.

===

Suppose data are provided in a "entity-attribute-value" format.

site | species | n
1    | lynx    |   2 
1    | hare    | 341 
2    | lynx    |   7 
2    | hare    |  42 
3    | hare    | 289 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
counts <- read.delim(sep = '|', header = TRUE, text = "
site | species | n
1    | lynx    |   2
1    | hare    | 341
2    | lynx    |   7
2    | hare    |  42
3    | hare    | 289
")
```

===

Transform the data with the `spread` function, which "reverses" a `gather`.

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
wide_counts <- spread(counts,
  key = species,
  value = n)
```

===

```{r}
wide_counts
```

===

Question
: Why were `species` and `n` not quoted in the call to `spread`?

Answer
: {:.fragment} They refer to existing column names. In `gather`, quotes are used to create new column names.

===

Think about what "missing data" means in this table. Perhaps you can safely do:

```{r, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
wide_counts <- spread(counts,
  key = species,
  value = n,
  fill = 0)
```

===

```{r}
wide_counts
```
===

## Exercise 1

Now that we have a wide form of counts, convert it to a `tidy_counts` data frame using `gather`. The only difference between `counts` and `tidy_counts` should be the additional row for zero lynx at site 3. Remember, a tidy dataset has a row for every observation, even if the value is "implied".
